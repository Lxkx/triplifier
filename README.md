TO SET UP THE PROJECT

ON MAC 

Be sure to have python, you can download the latest version on:
[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Create a virtual environment where you will store the dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Switch to your new virtual environment using:
```
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

Verify that you are using your new virtual environment created:
